* Icons for Alternate Resource Panel


0.4 - 2014.12.27
-----------------------------------------------------------
* The MSL-1000 now only contains basic lab equipment. It weighs therefore much less and is easier to launch. Most experiments need additional equipment to run. This equipment is in transport containers and can be installed in the lab if the container is docked to the station.
* **3D Printing in Space**: New lab equipment and 3 new experiments for 3D printing in space.
* **Multi phase experiments**: Some experiments are split in multiple phases, each phase has different requirements.


0.3.90 - 2014.12.24
-----------------------------------------------------------
* Works without the Station Science Mod. You no longer need the Station Science Mod for some Experiments. This should help to maintain this mod.

0.3
-----------------------------------------------------------
* IVA for the MSL-1000
* Folding platform
* Airlock and handrails for the MEP-825
* There is a small possibility for a failure during robotic arm procedures. The probability does rise by use. EVA to the plattform to fix the problem.
