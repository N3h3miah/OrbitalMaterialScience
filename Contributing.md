# NEOS - Contributing
Nehemia Engineering Orbital Science - previously knows as OrbitalMaterialScience (OMS).

This document outlines some information useful if you wish to contribute to this mod. Any and all help, especially modelling, is greatly appreciated.


## Sources
Presumably you've already found this, but the source code for this mod is maintained on GitHub.  The original code is in [Nehemia's repository][10], whereas this current fork is maintained in [Micha's repository][11]

## Plugin

The plugin source code solution is in the **Plugin** directory.  The source has been developed on both Windows using [Visual Studio][20] and Linux using [MonoDevelop][21].

Eventual output is to the GameData/NehemiaInc/NE_Science_Common/Plugins directory.

### Project File
Every attempt has been made to keep the project file platform-agnostic. Please keep it this way if making changes to it.

The post-build script is using Xbuild commands; if you need to edit or add to this, you must edit the project file directly as there is no IDE support for this.

The KSP references use a relative path to "KSP_Dev" at the same level as the root directory of this mod's source code. This could either be a complete copy of the latest version of KSP, or a symlink to it.


### Source code formatting

When providing patches or pull requests, please adhere to the existing source code formatting in the source files.  Some files may have different formatting, but in general the following conventions are used in this mod:

* Indentation: 4 spaces
* Layout:
  * Opening braces on new line
  * Space between if/for/while and opening bracket
  * No space between function/method call and opening bracket
  * No trailing whitespace

To assist in keeping the formatting consistent, a [.editorconfig][22] file has been provided. There are plugins for most editors/IDEs to support this and using them is encouraged.

Any requests to change the formatting over the entire project will be ignored.

## Models
Models are, surprisingly, maintained in the **Models** directory.

The modelling tool used to create these is [Blender][30]. For consistencies sake, any new models should also be created using Blender, but ultimately there is no requirement to actually do so.

## Unity Projects
The **Unity Projects** directory contains the Unity configuration for all parts used in NEOS.

The projects are in the process of being updated to Unity **5.4.0p4**, which can be downloaded directly from the [Unity website][40].

Each project contains the [PartTools][41] plugin, which must be added to any new projects. Older projects are in the process of being upgraded from PartTools 0.23.

### Textures
Model textures must be exported in the **MDM** format to ensure that they can be replaced with other formats with different file extensions.

After generating the final files, textures should be converted to **DDS** format. While various utilities exist, the easiest by far is the [KSP to DDS textured converter][42] although it is currently only available for Windows.

## Part Configurations
The actual KSP Part and Experiment Configurations are maintained directly in the **GameData** directory.

## Making a Release
Version information is maintained in various **.version** files in the **GameData** directory hierarchy. Update as required; at the very least the "Build Version" should be incremented.

Each component of NEOS is versioned individually, the idea being that updating part of the mod would only require downloading that part. This is especially important for people on slow internet connections and could be leveraged by [CKAN][60].

To make a release, a [NAnt build script][61] is provided. Edit this to update the version numbers, then run **nant** in the top-level directory to generate the various release files.
